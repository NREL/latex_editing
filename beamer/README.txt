For users with MiKTeX 2.9, the style files can be moved to the analogous folders
within the directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex\beamer\base\themes",
while the image files can be placed within the "inner" folder.  After moving the files,
the user should run "mo.exe" from the directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64"
and select "Refresh FNDB".  The file "NREL_Beamer_Template.tex" can be located in any
folder and used to create new beamer documents.
